# Credit-Card-Risk-Assessment_ML
Credit card risk assessment is a critical task in the financial industry, aiming to predict whether a credit card holder will default on their payment. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze and model customer data, identifying patterns and factors that indicate a high risk of default. By accurately predicting defaults, financial institutions can make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and ensure financial stability. This project outlines the process from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment, highlighting the balance between creativity and data-driven decision-making.
